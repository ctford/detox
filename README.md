# Detox



### OK, OK, how do I use it?

### How do I make my own validators?

### I just want to lay out my validations in a map like the other clojure libraries - how do I do that?
 // explain why this isn't great - coupling to data strucure shape

### What do I do if I have validations that dependent on multiple other validations?

### Right, I got some errors out, how do I translate them into error messages?

### I keep forgetting to add translations for errors when I update my validator...

### Can I parse values when I'm validating stuff?

### Ok, I've got one for you, I want to run a single validator in multiple places in my data, can I do that?
