Reviewing other Clojure libraries:

Things to check:  
  A) Validations coupled to data structure?
  B) Can I compare values in different locations? (e.g. minAge and maxAge)
  C) Can I interrogate validator for possible errors?
  D) Are validators composable?
  E) Can I update values?
  F) Can I run a single validator against multiple different locations?
  G) Can I see what constraints the validator was run against?
